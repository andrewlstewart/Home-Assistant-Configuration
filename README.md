<p>This is the home assistant configuration for my home. Other home assistant users may find some benefit in the automations and work-arounds I've written to control my smart devices.  I took a fair amount of this from Bahnburner's config <a href="https://github.com/Bahnburner/Home-Assistant-Config">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Controllable devices:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Google Home which can control the lights via the Emulated Hue component</li>
<li>Logitech Harmony Hub</li>
<li>Darksky weather forecasting</li>
<li>Sonarr upcoming TV shows list </li>
<li>Smartthings Hub <i>via MQTT</i></li>
<li>GE Z-wave wall receipticles</li>

</ul>
